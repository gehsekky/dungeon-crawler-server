### overview

this project is an experiment into game design basics for the turn based rpg genre.

### game mechanics

the game starts off at turn 0. once you enter a movement action, it kicks off a new "move" aka turn. in our particular context, a turn encompasses the movement into a given room and the story takes place after you've entered the room.
